<BR>Our Commitment to Children's Privacy.
<BR>We at Perfect World Aera Malaysia International take the online safety of children very seriously. The website is designed 

and maintained for an audience at 18 years old and above. For this reason every member registration asks for date of birth 

and our best efforts are made to insure the integrity of our minimum age policy. The Children's Online Privacy Protection 

Act ('COPPA') requires that we inform parents and legal guardians about how we collect, use, and disclose personal 

information from children under 13 years of age. Although the Perfect World Aera Malaysia International website is not 

directed at children under 13 years of age, we recognize that with proper adult supervision some parents might permit 

their children to visit and utilize the site. COPPA requires that we obtain the consent of parents and guardians in order 

for children under 13 years of age to use certain features of the website. When your child attempts to register and/or 

provide personal information to Perfect World Aera Malaysia International, we require a parent or legal guardian to 

complete the registration review our privacy policy and to submit a valid credit card number to verify that the child's 

parent or guardian knows about and authorizes our information practices related to children protected by COPPA. Once 

parental notice and consent has been verified, the information we collect will be treated the same as information 

collected from any other user of the Perfect World Aera Malaysia International website. Without verified parental notice 

and consent, we will not knowingly collect personal information of children under 13 years of age, and if we learn that we 

have inadvertently collected such information, we will promptly delete it. In compliance with COPPA, parents and legal 

guardians may request us to review, delete or stop the collection of the personally identifiable information of their 

child. You may do so in one of two ways.
<BR>
<BR>If you would like to review the information collected, please mail us at abuse@perfectworld.com.my
<BR>
<BR>We are also not affiliated with any of the already named organizations/companies or to put it straight any association, 

organization or company that is related to Perfect World. This is strictly a fan based development non-profitable 

association.
