                  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Venomancers, while offering varied playstyle options, are essentially a 'pet class'. The 'pet' is an NPC ally that, in most cases, fights in the front lines, holding enemies at bay, and hopefully their attention off of the less well armored pet owner, while the pet owner uses spells from range. Although pet classes can be weaker or even problematic in groups, Perfect World Venomancers have proved their worth in groups as 'pullers', exploiting monster behaviour to bring single monsters to the group and avoiding taking on the whole pack of monsters at once. Pet classes are also typically average speed but capable soloers, and often the only class that can solo the biggest and most powerful monsters, and Venomancers are no exception to this rule.</p>

                  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Venomancers are unique in having two trainers: one for normal magic skills, and a separate Pet Skill Trainer. Although it is likely Venomancers will only ever be using the first level of Pet Charm or Pet Revive, as higher levels are not worth the Spirit cost early on, do not forget to occasionally visit to pick up the next level of Pet Heal, which makes a huge difference. </p>
