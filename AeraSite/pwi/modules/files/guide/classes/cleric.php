                  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A <strong>Cleric</strong> is Winged Elf class whose element is mainly metal, so   their offensive spells are lightning. Clerics are the only class that   can cast healing spells on themselves and fellow squad members, as well   as revive fallen players. Because of their abilities, they are a   valuable and heavily sought-after asset to any squad, especially if the   squad is about to enter a dungeon. Like most other spell-casters, the   weapons of choice for a Cleric are wands, patakas, magic swords, and   glaives. Clerics can fly indefinitely with the natural elven wings, but   their attacks are noticeably weaker while in the air. Flying is,   however, a good tactic if fighting in a sqaud with players who are   higher level than you, as aggressive enemies will not attack you if you   are flying and you can still heal your allies. </p>
