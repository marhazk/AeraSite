  <p>Player can become a mentor to somebody in this game. This also known as AeraPromotion. Also, the other player also can become your student (you as their mentor). The advantage this Mentor System is, your Battlepower point is increased and so does your Aerapoint once they reach level 50. It helps you to gain level up. Since the server has achieved the player requirements, we want to thank to players who always supporting this server.</p>
