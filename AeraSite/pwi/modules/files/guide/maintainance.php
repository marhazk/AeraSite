<p>To ensure perfect server performance, all servers for Perfect World : Aera are 
updated <strong>everyday at 12:00~12:30 GMT+8</strong>, and account server is maintained on <strong>every Wednesday at 
18:00 - 18:30 GMT+8</strong>. During this period, if you try to log into the game, 
the following message will pop up: &quot;Failed to connect to game server. Please log in later.&quot; <br />
