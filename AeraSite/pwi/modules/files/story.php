    <h1>Perfect World</h1>
    <h4>In the beginning of time, the first God of the universe, Pan Gu,   lived an immortal life. But with no subjects to lord over, Pan Gu grew   tired of his solitary existence and decided to decompose his body into   five elements-fire, metal, wood, earth, and water.</h4>

    <h5>The foundation</h5>
    <p>With his divine power, Pan Gu forged these elements into air, land,   mountains, rivers, seas, and plant life and laid the foundation for a   new world.  It was then that Pan Gu made his first attempt to fill this   new world with life. From his shadow he formed the first sentient   beings. These unnamed creatures were uncivilized, and before long, they   began turning on one another and corrupting the world around them. Pan   Gu saw that what he had created had become an Imperfect World, and moved   quickly to rectify his mistake. He built a floating city known as   Heaven's Tear, and placed within the city the few creatures that had yet   to be corrupted. Then, with the power of water and wind, Pan Gu created   a massive flood, which swept through the land and destroyed all life in   its path.</p>

    <h5>Three Races</h5>
    <p>The world now cleansed, Pan Gu set about creating a new world, one   filled with beings who were capable of Spiritual Cultivation. He created   three races that possessed the traits he most treasured in himself. The   Human race was born of Pan Gu's spirit, and demonstrated morality,   honor, and an unlimited imagination. The race of the Untamed, born of   Pan Gu's body, embodied freedom and peace, and possessed a unique   connection with the natural order of the world. And the third race, the   Winged Elves, were born of Pan Gu's own blood, and exemplified beauty,   grace, and purity. Between the three races, the Perfect World was   created.</p>

    <h5>Choose your alliance</h5>
    <p>The chief quality that Pan Gu gave all three races was free will.   He vowed never again to eradicate an entire species, so all conflicts   between the races were to be resolved amongst themselves. One such   conflict arose between the Humans and Winged Elves when the two races   discovered the city of Heaven's Tear. A war erupted as they fought for   control of the great city, bringing out the worst in both races. The   Untamed remained neutral, as they were content with living in harmony   with the natural world. As the war intensified, and neither side   relented, a new threat emerged.</p>
    <p>The race that was thought to have been eradicated in the great   flood returned in full force. These creatures were not quite living, but   not quite dead, and thus came to be known as wraiths. The wraiths   appeared to possess a singular objective: to destroy the other races and   corrupt the beautiful world around them. Rumors swirled that the   wraiths were capable of possessing other living things. Not much is   known about the true nature of this evil, but one thing is clear. The   three races Human, Untamed, and Winged Elf must set aside their   differences and unite to preserve their way of life, halt the spread of   corruption, and above all, protect the Perfect World.</p>
    <p>Enter the Perfect World, choose your alliance, and join the adventure!</p>
