        Customer shall not transmit or disseminate unsolicited commercial e-mail   (UCE), or unsolicited bulk messages (Spam), including advertisements,   informational distributions, and charitable or other solicitations.  The abuse and misuse of e-mail is a serious problem, and PW:Aera cannot   and will not tolerate it. This policy covers all servers and domains on   our network. </p>

              We have a strict policy regarding use/spam on our network, but we do   allow use of mailing lists within the constraints of our spam policy.   However, sending thousands of e-mails off of a given server can impact   the performance of the server. Therefore we limit the amount of e-mail   allowed on our Shared Hosting Servers to no more than 200 e-mails per   hours per account. </p>

        Because the Internet is a global communication tool, and we have clients   from nearly every country in the world it is difficult to dictate what   is considered "adult material." However, it is not our function to   discriminate against those who choose to utilize adult content or adult   related material. This being said, there are still several reasons why   PW:Aera has been forced to create its no adult sites policy for PW:Aera   network. </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Any site whose revenue is gained in part or whole from its adult content.</li>
          <li>Hyperlinks to adult sites, including but not limited to sites who violate these policies.</li>
          <li>Sites that have discussion boards and share information that is &lsquo;adult&rsquo; in nature.</li>

            <p><strong>Child Pornography</strong><br>
              Child pornography includes related material, such as simulated child   pornography, non-nude child pornography, or sites linking to such   material, whether it is determined to be legal or not. Offenses of this   nature will be reported to the federal authorities and prosecuted to the   fullest extent of the law.

      <td>Server Resources Abuse</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><p> PW:Aera allows CGI, PHP, Perl and many other normal processes used for   hosting to be used on all Virtual Servers. These processes can be   resource intensive however, and because a Virtual Server must be shared   with other users, we must limit how much of the CPU, memory, disk I/O,   disk space and database use can be used by any one account on a shared   server. Therefore any program (application, script, etc.) or usage that   consumes too many resources that impacts other customers in either   performance or reliability is considered resource abuse. Shared servers   are &lsquo;shared&rsquo; and we all need to play fair. <br>
        <br>
        Examples include: </p>
        <p><strong>Background Running Processes</strong><br>
          Background Daemons in general are prohibited on PW:Aera's servers,   including, but not limited to, IRC bots, eggdrop, BitchX, XiRCON, warez   sites and any other program that interferes with normal server   operation. </p>
        <p><strong>Cron Jobs</strong><br>
          We allow customers to set up cron jobs to perform routine functions   automatically. Due to the impact on the server, running some automated   processes can take up considerable server resources and in those cases,   our technicians may disable the cron job. </p>
        <p><strong>Maximum MYSQL Database Size</strong><br>
          We allow unlimited number of MySQL databases, but in the interest of   server stability, you have to try to keep them optimized, less than 3000   tables per database or less than a total of 5000 tables combination of   all databases per hosting account and less than a total 5 GB size   combination of all databases per account, whichever is lower. </p>
        <p><strong>Archive or Backup Storage</strong><br>
          Using shared hosting account as a backup/storage device is not   permitted. This includes but not limited to Video, Music, ISO, archiving   of electronic files, log files. </p>
        <p><strong>Exploitable Scripts</strong><br>
          Unfortunately, many commonly used scripts can be exploited to allow   unauthorized users into our systems. Consequently we may on occasion   need to ban and consequently disable these scripts. You can view the   most current exploits on our banned-scripts page. </p></td>
