    <h1>Mounts</h1>
    <h4>At level 30, all races unlock the ability to fly using aerocrafts.    Winged Elves start at level 1 with the ability to fly but their wings   consume MP with use.  At level 30, all races can use the aerocrafts to   fly without any penalty. </h4>
    <p>In order for you to be able to start using the aerocrafts, you must   first go to the Elder of Archosaur and complete the quest he gives you.    For all races, the quest tells you to go to your races recluse and   speak with them.  The Recluse will have you complete a task and after   that, you are able to use your races aerocraft.  While in flight, you   can use the Accelerate command to fly faster and that also has a   separate meter that drains with use.</p>
    <p>Additional mounts can be found at the Pet trainer in any city or in the Item Mall.</p>

    <h5>Upgrading your mount</h5>
    <p>In order to upgrade your flying mount you will need to travel to   Thousand Streams. This is where you will encounter the aerocraft forge   (117, 853). Simply click on this forge and it will show you all the   available flying mounts by race and type that you can upgrade. </p>
    <p>Once you have decided to update your mount you will need to access   the boutique shop and and purchase wind widgets. They can be located in   the Fly -&gt; Upgrades category. Now simply access the forge and find   your flying mount. </p>

    <h5>Fast Flight / Accelerated Flight Mode</h5>
    <p>As you can see here there are 2 versions of Israfel with   different flying speeds. In order to obtain the fastest version you will   need to make the first one first.</p>
    <p>To create this simply unequip your mount and be sure to have wind   widgets in your inventory and place them on the required matierals   icon. Doing this will light those requirements up, indiciating you have   fulfill the requirement.  Now simply hit start and it will create your   upgraded version. </p>
    <p>Its important to remember that you must do them in order because   without the previous version your flying mount cannot be upgraded.</p>
    <p>Witin in the emote page (E Key) there is a icon labeled   Accelerate. If you use this button while in flying mode you will enter   the Fast Speed mode of your aerocraft. Here the speed would be +4.50   meters/second. The amount of time you have in this mode is based on each   indiviudal craft. This flying craft has 300/600 seconds so you can   maintain this speed for that many seconds. </p>

    <h5>Chi Stones</h5>
    <p>The only way to refill this bar is to place Yiyuan stones or higher   into the item itself by simply dragging and dropping. What you must   keep in mind though is that to refill this bar it will take a very large   amount of stones so you might not want to use the accelerated mode so   hastily. </p>
    <p>Yiyuan stones and similar types can be created by decomposing items   such as weapons and armors. In order to get this ability you must learn   the manufacturering skill for the item you wish to decompose. For   example if you want to decompose weapons, you need blacksmithing, if you   want to decompose armor, you need to have tailor skill, and etc.</p>
